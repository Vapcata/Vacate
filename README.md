### 💡 About Me
- I have a growing interest in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, and I always try to learn new things and research topics in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The most interesting for me is NLP, and I love the newly developed ideas about transformers and attention, among many other things. I also enjoy spending time on projects that evolve my knowledge and skills!

- At night, I love going out to parties with my close friends, socializing, and meeting new people from all kinds of parts of life. I also occasionally play video games like League of Legends. My bigger brother gave me a PS2, and I love playing old-school games like Sims and Jack & Dexter a lot more.
