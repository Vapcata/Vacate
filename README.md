### üí° About Me
I have a growing interest in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, and I always try to learn new things and research topics in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The most interesting for me is NLP, and I love the newly developed ideas about transformers and attention, among many other things. I also enjoy spending time on projects that evolve my knowledge and skills!

At night, I love going out to parties with my close friends, socializing, and meeting new people from all kinds of parts of life. I also occasionally play video games like League of Legends. My bigger brother gave me a PS2, and I love playing old-school games like Sims and Jack & Dexter a lot more.

### üåü Projects

#### 1. Two Stage Detection of AgNORs from Histopathology Images
- **Technologies:** PyTorch, Custom Dataset Handling, Albumentations 
- **Description:** Developed an image processing pipeline to detect AgNORs in histopathology images, including image augmentations, classification, and object detection using PyTorch.
- **Achievements:** 
  - Implemented image classification with an F1-score performance measure.
  - Built an object detection model with a complete pipeline from initialization to performance reporting via AP.
  - Developed a two-stage pipeline combining cell detection and classification for computing an average AgNOR-score.

#### 2. Transformer Model for Machine Translation (English to German)
- **Technologies:** PyTorch, Europarl Parallel Corpus
- **Description:** Engineered a transformer-based machine translation system without using pre-trained weights; managed full lifecycle from model architecture design to training and evaluation.
- **Results:** Achieved a BLEU score between 50 - 60.
- **Training Details:** [Add details about model architecture, hyperparameters, etc.]
- **Training Loss Curve:** `![Training Loss Curve](path/to/loss_curve.png)`

#### 3. SMS Spam Classification
- **Technologies:** Custom TF-IDF Vectorizer, Naive Bayes Classifier
- **Description:** Created an SMS spam classifier implementing various text preprocessing techniques and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Performance:** [Add specifics of model performance and feature importance analysis]
- **Future Work:** Plans include improving model performance with LSTM, custom Bayes classifier, and exploring feature selection techniques.
